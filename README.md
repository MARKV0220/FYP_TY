*This is the repository for Tianchen Yu's Final Year Project of a smart glasses frame for navigational purposes in orienteering. It contains all core design files of the project and some supplementary files are not uploaded for the clarity of repository structure*

**Datasheet**: All related datasheets for the eletronic system of the glasses frame are included in this folder

**Glasses 3D Model**: All 3D modelling files of the glasses frame mechanical system are included in this folder. It also contains many iterations of the 3D model designs. The design is based on *AutoCAD*

**Glasses Programs**: Two different versions of the program for glasses frame are included in this folder. Both of them are based on Arduino IDE. The basic version enables the core functions of the glasses frame including LED interface, buzzing, magnetic meter and simple user interaction. The advanced version adds the implementations of inertial units, data recording system and a more complex LED interface together with a more rigorous time sequence.

**Logbook**: This folder contains the logbook of the project, which is specifically designed to be complementary material to the thesis. The description and analysis that have been covered in the thesis in great detail are not repeated in the logbook. There are also some drafts in this folder, mainly about the designing process of the overall architecture of the glasses frame and the mechanical structure of it.

**MATLAB Signal Processing**: All data samples collected in field validations and the corresponding signal processing scripts are included in this folder.

**PCB Designs**: This folder contains all the PCB design files, specifically the schematics and PCB layout designs of left leg, middle frame and right leg PCBs. All designs are based on *Altium Designer*
